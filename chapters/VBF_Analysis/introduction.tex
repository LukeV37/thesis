\section{Search for Hadronic Higgs Decays in Vector Boson Fusion Production Mode}

A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson decaying to a charm quark–antiquark pair $H \rightarrow c\bar{c}$ and
a bottom quark–antiquark pair $H \rightarrow b\bar{b}$ via vector-boson fusion (VBF) production is presented. For the
$H \rightarrow c\bar{c}$ search, the analysis uses proton–proton collision data collected by the ATLAS detector at two
centre-of-mass energies: $37 fb^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s} = 13 TeV$ from 2018, and $51 fb^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s} = 13 TeV$ from
2022 and 2023, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of $89 fb^{-1}$. The observed (expected)
upper limit on the $H \rightarrow c\bar{c}$ production cross-section times branching ratio is 41 (27) times the Standard
Model prediction at the 95\% confidence level (CL). The Higgs boson decay to a bottom quark–antiquark
pair $H \rightarrow b\bar{b}$ is simultaneously measured using the $51 fb^{-1}$ of proton–proton collision data at
$\sqrt{s} = 13 TeV$ collected during 2022 and 2023. The observed $H \rightarrow b\bar{b}$ event rate relative to the
Standard Model expectation is $0.97^{+0.57}_{-0.50}$.
When combined with the previous search for $H \rightarrow c\bar{c}$ via
associated production with a W or Z boson (VH), the observed (expected) 95\% CL interval on the
Higgs–charm Yukawa coupling modifier, $\kappa_c$, is $|\kappa_c|<4.7(3.9)$. In addition, this result is combined with
the previous ATLAS measurement of VBF $H \rightarrow b\bar{b}$, leading to the first evidence of VBF production
with $H \rightarrow b\bar{b}$, with an observed (expected) significances of 3.3(3.7) standard deviations.
