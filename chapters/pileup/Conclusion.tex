\section{Conclusion}\hfill

In conclusion, we presented the following contributions.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We proposed a first-of-its-kind pileup prediction modeled as a regression problem.
    \item We proposed a cross-attention based neural network architecture that utilizes jets and tracks information for pileup fraction detection.
    \item We showed with extensive analysis that the proposed method outperforms the baseline approaches.
    \item We also showed that the predictions from the proposed approach also assist with physics processes.
\end{enumerate}
