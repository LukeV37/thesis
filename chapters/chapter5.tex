\section{Outline}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Use Attention based model, GN2X to tag boosted large-R jets
  \item After identifying jets, now we calibrate MC/data and object performance studies
  \item Boosted ttbar selections
  \item calibration plots
  \item Mention c-tagging
  \item Now that we have calibrated objects, we can start to do physics with emphasis on higgs
\end{itemize}
