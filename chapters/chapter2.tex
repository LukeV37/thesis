\section{Outline}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Standard model is huge success but there are open problems
  \item QED and QCD
  \item Feynman diagrams that describe VH and VBF bb/cc verticies with lagrangian
  \item we prove these couplings, and deviations would demonstrate new physics
  \item Higgs yukawa couplings to third and second generations. tH and signs of kappa wrt VH
  \item Why is this physics important? Why are these channels important?
  \item Why is this important to stability of the universe? Higgs potential.
  \item A few things beyond VBF Higgs
\end{itemize}
