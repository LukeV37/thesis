\section{Outline}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Standard model is huge success but there are open problems
  \item QED and QCD
  \item Feynman diagrams that describe VH and VBF bb/cc verticies with lagrangian
  \item By finding deviations in the cross section and coupling constant we indirectly are searching for new physics
  \item Higgs yukawa couplings to third and second generations fermions.
  \item Why is this physics important? Why are these channels important?
  \item Why is this important to stability of the universe? Higgs potential.
  \item A few things beyond Higgs. The future of HEP research.
\end{itemize}
