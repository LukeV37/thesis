\section{Outline}

\begin{itemize}
  \item HL-LHC shutdown
  \item Next 3 years detector will undergo huge transformation
  \item Huge amount of pileup
  \item This work benefits entire experiment. Not for a specific analysis.
  \item Important to address pileup to maximize the discovery potential of the ATLAS detector at HL-LHC conditions.
\end{itemize}
